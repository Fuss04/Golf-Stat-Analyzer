Golf-Stat-Analyzer
==================

The Golf-Stat-Analyzer is aimed to help golfer see where they are lossing shots, so they can practice more in those areas. Currently are working on changing over the UI to iOS7. In this process, I will be take out all storyboards and converting everything to code.
WARNING:
    Things will be broken and not fully functional as I start to gut out the storyboard and change it over to constraints.
